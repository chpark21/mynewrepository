    <h1>How to Make Instant Cup Noodles</h1>
    <p>Hey there! Have you never made an instant noodle before? Well, let's get started!</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Tear the lid of the Cup Noodles halfway.</li>
      <li>Take out all the seasoning packets inside.</li>
      <li>Carefully tear the plastic packet with powdered seasoning, and pour it onto the noodle.</li>
      <li>Add boiling water into the cup until it reaches the line inside. If for some reason you cannot find the line, pour the boiling water for around 2/3 of the cup.</li>
      <li>Reseal the lid and put a book(or something to cover the lid)</li>
      <li>Wait for around 2 to 3 minutes and get your chopstick.</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
